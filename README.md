# PleaseHold
A game where you play as a mid 20th century telephone switchboard operator, made for the Extra Credits 2019 game jam.

## How to build
If for whatever reason you want to build this code, follow these steps:
1. Download/clone the repo
2. Navigate inside the root directory of the repo (with the readme file)
3. Clone [Ossium](https://github.com/SpectralCascade/Ossium) into that directory.
4. Do a `git checkout 8e867fa3758f71d8a15b449faf21dea82b78fa57` to get the version of Ossium that last worked with this repo.
5. Setup SDL (here's a [handy tutorial link](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php))
6. Compile PleaseHold using Code::Blocks 17.12 or newer, with a compiler that supports C++17 (I used GCC 8).
