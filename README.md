# PleaseHold
A game where you play as a mid 20th century telephone switchboard operator, made for the Extra Credits 2019 game jam.

## How to build
Turns out I haven't pushed all the code yet so it's not the same as the build I made for the game jam. However I am updating it to work with the current version of Ossium so hopefully I'll get it pushed up soon.
~If for whatever reason you want to build this code, follow these steps:~
~1. Download/clone the repo~
~2. Navigate inside the root directory of the repo (with the readme file)~
~3. Clone [Ossium](https://github.com/SpectralCascade/Ossium) into that directory.~
~4. Do a `git checkout ` to get the version of Ossium that last worked with this repo.~
~5. Setup SDL (here's a [handy tutorial link](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php))~
~6. Compile PleaseHold using Code::Blocks 17.12 or newer, with a compiler that supports C++17 (I used GCC 8).~
